DEFINNING GUIDELLINE FOR:

-Format (int, float, string): 
Returns the result of interpreting leading characters in str as a floating point number
Examples:
number = gets.chomp.to_f 
int: to_i
number = gets.chomp.to_i
string: to_s
string = gets.chomp.to_s

-Classes: This is the unit way that a I found to create  classes: Keyword= class followed by the name class
class Animal
 #code
end
-Methods:
I suggest to use the next format because it is more unsdertable from my pointbecause is more understable 
for people that is new in ruby and is familiria with another languajes :

def rest(number1,number2)
rest = number1 - number2
end

-Variables, Getter/Setter

people that is new in ruby languaje and is familiari with other langauges.


class Object
  def initialize(object_name, number)
    @object_name = object_name
    @number = number
  end
  
  def object_name
    @object_name
  end
end

puts number = 10 if  number = 100
